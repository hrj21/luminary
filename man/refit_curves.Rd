refit_curves(

\arguments{
\item{.data}{Intelliframe object to refit}

\item{npars}{A numeric value (or \code{"all"}) to specify the number of
parameters to use in the model. If \code{"all"} the logistic model will be
tested with 2 to 5 parameters, and the best option will be returned.
See Details.}

\item{weight_method}{A character string to specify what weight method to use.
Options are \code{"res"}(default), \code{"sdw"}, \code{"gw"}. See Details.}

\item{LPweight}{a coefficient to adjust the weights. \code{LPweight = 0} will
compute a non-weighted np-logistic regression.}

\item{add_to_zeroes}{A numeric value (\code{0.1} by default) added to zeros during
the curve fitting procedure as it requires the concentration to be
log10-transformed.}

\item{silent}{Logical flag indicating whether warnings and/or messages during
curve fitting should be silenced. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\description{
Function to refit n-parameter logistic curves to standards in an intelliframe object
and interpolate concentrations for all samples, based on the updated models.

\details{
Most of these details have been reproduced from the \code{\link{nplr}} function that is doing most of the heavy lifting.

The 5-parameter logistic regression is of the form:
\deqn{y = B + (T - B)/[1 + 10^{(b*(x_{\text{mid}} - x))}]^s}

where \eqn{B} and \eqn{T} are the bottom and top asymptotes, respectively,
\eqn{b} and \eqn{x_{\text{mid}}} are the Hill slope and the x-coordinate at
the inflection point, respectively, and \eqn{s} is an asymmetric coefficient.
This equation is sometimes referred to as the Richards' equation [1,2].
When specifying \code{npars = 4}, the \eqn{s} parameter is forced to be 1,
and the corresponding model is a 4-parameter logistic regression, symmetrical
around its inflection point. When specifying \code{npars = 3} or \code{npars = 2},
add 2 more constraints and force \eqn{B} and \eqn{T} to be 0 and 1, respectively.

Weight methods:

The model parameters are optimized, simultaneously, using \code{\link{nlm}},
given a sum of squared errors function, \eqn{\text{sse(Y)}}, to minimize:
\deqn{\text{sse}(Y) = Î£ [W(Y_{\text{obs}} - Y_{\text{fit}})^2 ]}
  where \eqn{Y_{\text{obs}}}, \eqn{Y_{\text{fit}}} and \eqn{W} are the vectors
of observed values, fitted values and weights, respectively.
In order to reduce the effect of possible outliers, the weights can be computed in different ways:

residual weights, \code{"res"}:
\deqn{W = (1/\text{residuals})^\text{LPweight}}
where \eqn{\text{residuals}} and \eqn{\text{LPweight}} are the squared error
between the observed and fitted values, and a tuning parameter, respectively.
Best results are generally obtained by setting \code{LPweight = 0.25} (default value),
while setting \code{LPweight = 0} results in computing a non-weighted sum of squared errors.

standard weights, \code{"sdw"}:
\deqn{W = 1/\text{Var}(Y_{\text{obs}_r})}
where \eqn{\text{Var}(Y_{\text{obs}_r})} is the vector of the within-replicates variances.

general weights, \code{"gw"}:
\deqn{W = 1/Y_{\text{fit}}^\text{LPweight}}
where \eqn{Y_{\text{fit}}} are the fitted values. As for the residuals-weights method,
setting \eqn{LPweight = 0} results in computing a non-weighted sum of squared errors.
The standard weights and general weights methods are described in [3].
