\usage{
refit_curves(
  .data,
  npars = "all",
  weight_method = "res",
  add_to_zeroes = 0.01,
  silent = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{Intelliframe object to refit}

\item{npars}{A numeric value (or \code{"all"}) to specify the number of
parameters to use in the model. If \code{"all"} the logistic model will be
tested with 2 to 5 parameters, and the best option will be returned.
See Details.}

\item{weight_method}{A character string to specify what weight method to use.
Options are \code{"res"}(default), \code{"sdw"}, \code{"gw"}. See Details.}

\item{add_to_zeroes}{A numeric value (\code{0.1} by default) added to zeros during
the curve fitting procedure as it requires the concentration to be
log10-transformed.}

\item{silent}{Logical flag indicating whether warnings and/or messages during
curve fitting should be silenced. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\description{
Function to refit n-parameter logistic curves to standards in an intelliframe object
and interpolate concentrations for all samples, based on the updated models.

\details{
The 5-parameter logistic regression is of the form:
y = B + (T - B)/\link{1 + 10^(b*(xmid - x))}^s

where B and T are the bottom and top asymptotes, respectively, b and xmid are the Hill slope and the x-coordinate at the inflexion point, respectively, and s is an asymetric coefficient. This equation is sometimes refered to as the Richards' equation \link{1,2}.
When specifying npars = 4, the s parameter is forced to be 1, and the corresponding model is a 4-parameter logistic regression, symetrical around its inflexion point. When specifying npars = 3 or npars = 2, add 2 more constraints and force B and T to be 0 and 1, respectively.
Weight methods:
The model parameters are optimized, simultaneously, using nlm, given a sum of squared errors function, sse(Y), to minimize:
sse(Y) = Î£ \link{W.(Yobs - Yfit)^2 }
where Yobs, Yfit and W are the vectors of observed values, fitted values and weights, respectively.
In order to reduce the effect of possible outliers, the weights can be computed in different ways, specified in nplr:
residual weights, "res":
W = (1/residuals)^LPweight
where residuals and LPweight are the squared error between the observed and fitted values, and a tuning parameter, respectively. Best results are generally obtained by setting LPweight = 0.25 (default value), while setting LPweight = 0 results in computing a non-weighted sum of squared errors.
standard weights, "sdw":
W = 1/Var(Yobs_r)
where Var(Yobs_r) is the vector of the within-replicates variances.
general weights, "gw":
W = 1/Yfit^LPweight
where Yfit are the fitted values. As for the residuals-weights method, setting LPweight = 0 results in computing a non-weighted sum of squared errors.
The standard weights and general weights methods are describes in \link{3}.
